# CarePlanner
This app helps medical staff evaluate and document the time spent on patient care in accordance with the PPBV ("Pflegepersonalbemessungsverordnung").

The highlight features are:
* Classifying patients according to their needs in different care categories on daily basis, resulting in a daily care time for each patient
* Easily checking which patients still need to be classified for each station
* Importing staff shift plans for easy comparison of planned care capacities vs. actually needed capacities based on the daily care time
* Exporting analysis of monthly patient care time for sending to Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesgesundheitsministerium)
